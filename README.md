# Automation & Life Improvements
Welcome to this repository. This repository hosts all the code
I write to improve my experience in various things. Some of these things
are automation based and some of them are just tools.

## Current Programs
Currently, I have 1 active automated script and 1 tool that helps me with life:

* [File Sorter](file_sorter.py) (automated using cronjob) sorts my downloads 
into different folders. (Only for Linux at this time)
* [Extract Installed Packages](extract_installed.py) (tool) extracts packages
you prompted to install using your package manager. Supports apt, yum, snap,
and rpm.
